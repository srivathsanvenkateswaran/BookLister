# BookLister

BookLister is an app which would return the list of books related to the topic after the user specifies the search term [the topic]. 

The App gives you the average rating of the of the book in Google Books, Small Thumbnail Image of the Book, Name of the book, Author name, Number of pages and also whether the PDF of book is available or not. 

The App fetches the data from Google Books API. 

You can get more info about each book by clicking at the particular book. You will be redirected to the selected book's page on Google Books website.  

Note: 
  I am yet to update the UI of the app with a search interface and hence, for time sake, I have used an EditText and an ImageButton to mimic the Search Interfacec. Hence, you can perform the search opearation only once and in order to perform another search operation, you would have to reload the app again i.e. close the app and launch it again.
  
  This will be fixed soon...
